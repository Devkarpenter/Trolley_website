# Trolley Next (starter)

A minimal Next.js + TailwindCSS starter for a trolley ecommerce demo.

Quick start

1. cd into the project

```powershell
cd trolley-next
```

2. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Notes

- Tailwind is preconfigured. Edit `styles/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.js` to customize.
- This project uses the App Router (`app/`). If you prefer the Pages Router, let me know.
- I did not run `npm install` or start the dev server — run the commands above locally.
